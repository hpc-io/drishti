# Drishti: I/O Insights for All

Dristhi is a novel interactive web-based analysis framework to visualize I/O traces, highlight bottlenecks, and help understand the I/O behavior of scientific applications. Drishti aims to fill the gap between the trace collection, analysis, and tuning phases. The framework contains an interactive I/O trace analysis component for end-users to visually inspect their applications' I/O behavior, focusing on areas of interest and getting a clear picture of common root causes of I/O performance bottlenecks. Based on the automatic detection of I/O performance bottlenecks, our framework maps numerous common and well-known bottlenecks and their solution recommendations that can be implemented by users.
