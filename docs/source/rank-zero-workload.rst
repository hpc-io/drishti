Rank Zero Heavy Workload Plot
===================================

Once the dependencies and DXT Explorer have been installed:

.. code-block:: bash

   dxt-explorer -r DARSHAN_FILE_COLLECTED_WITH_DXT_ENABLE.darshan

.. image:: _static/images/rank-zero.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: Rank Zero Workload Plot

This will generate the base ``operation.html`` plot. On the right of the ``operation.html`` plot, a dropdown menu will be displayed which will have an option to display ``rank zero heavy workload`` bottleneck, if that bottleneck exists. Upon clicking that button, the rank zero workload will be highlighted on the graph with the other operations in the background in an opaque color. Contextual information link ``Rank``, ``Operation``, ``Duration``, ``Size``, ``Offset``, ``Lustre OST`` can also be seen by hovering over a request. 

This is the expected console output when calling DXT Explorer:

.. code-block:: text
