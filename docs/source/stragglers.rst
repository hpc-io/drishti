Stragglers Plot
===================================

Once the dependencies and DXT Explorer have been installed:

.. code-block:: bash

   dxt-explorer -st DARSHAN_FILE_COLLECTED_WITH_DXT_ENABLE.darshan

.. image:: _static/images/dxt-explorer-stragglers-zoom.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: Stragglers Plot

This will generate the base ``operation.html`` plot. On the right of the ``operation.html`` plot, a dropdown menu will be displayed which will have an option to display ``stragglers``, if that bottleneck exists. Upon clicking that button, the stragglers will be highlighted on the graph. Contextual information link ``Fastest Rank``, ``Fastest Rank Duration``, ``Slowest Rank``, ``Slowest Rank Duration`` can also be seen by hovering over a request. 

This is the expected console output when calling DXT Explorer:

.. code-block:: text
