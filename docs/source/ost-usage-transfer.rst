OST Usage Transfer Plot
===================================

Once the dependencies and DXT Explorer have been installed:

.. code-block:: bash

   dxt-explorer -ot DARSHAN_FILE_COLLECTED_WITH_DXT_ENABLE.darshan

.. image:: _static/images/dxt-explorer-ost-transfer.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: OST Usage Transfer Plot

This will generate the ``ost-usage-transfer.html`` plot. The ``ost-usage-transfer.html`` plot shows the data transferred by each OST server for read and write operations throughout the runtime of the application.

``Warning``: This plot will only be generated if the application was exectued on Lustre File System and Darshan collected those metrics. 

This is the expected console output when calling DXT Explorer:

.. code-block:: text
