I/O Phase Plot
===================================

Once the dependencies and DXT Explorer have been installed:

.. code-block:: bash

   dxt-explorer -i DARSHAN_FILE_COLLECTED_WITH_DXT_ENABLE.darshan

.. image:: _static/images/dxt-explorer-io-phases.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: I/O Phase Plot

This will generate the base ``io-phase.html`` plot. The ``io-phase.html`` plot shows the different I/O Phases in the data. The plot also shows information regarding the number of I/O phases in each interface (``MPIIO and POSIX``) and the threshold value used to merge the phases. The threshold value is computed by summing the mean and standard deviation of all the intervals between the I/O phases. Contextual information link ``Fastest Rank``, ``Fastest Rank Duration``, ``Slowest Rank``, ``Slowest Rank Duration`` can also be seen by hovering over a phase. 

This is the expected console output when calling DXT Explorer:

.. code-block:: text
